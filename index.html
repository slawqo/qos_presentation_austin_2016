# QoS in Liberty

.left[
In the Liberty design summit, a model to provide
quality of service in a gerneric way was proposed.

# QoS in Liberty

## Egress bandwidth limit for:

* Open vSwitch L2 agent
* SR-IOV L2 agent

???

To say:
* QoS only with one rule type: egress traffic limiting
* implementation only for ovs and SR-IOV L2 agents.
* Missing support for _LinuxBridge_ agent.
* Implementation done  as L2 extension drivers - new mechanism in Liberty

---

class: center

# Egress bandwidth limit rule:

1. Create policy
```bash
neutron qos-policy-create example-policy
```
2. Create bandwidth limit rule:
```bash
neutron qos-bandwidth-limit-rule-create --max-kbps 512 \
                                            --max-burst-kbps 1024 \
                                            example-policy
```
3. Apply policy for port/network
```bash
neutron port-update 071e54ad-d5f5-402f-933f-dece0db3afde \
                        --qos-policy example-policy
```

???

__Ask how many people know already QoS.__

Short remind. How QoS works in Neutron. If You want to configure bw...

# Apply egress bandwidth limit rule in Openvswitch agent

```bash
ovs-vsctl set Interface tap1 ingress_policing_rate=512
ovs-vsctl set Interface tap1 ingress_policing_burst=1024
```

![OVS Bridge connection](images/OVS_Bridge_connection.png)


???
On this picture You can see how VM is connected to network using OVS bridge.
OVS L2 agent will apply bw limit from previous slide in two simple commands…

Underneath ovs using TC to apply this ingress policing rules....

# Egress bandwidth limit in Mitaka

## support for LinuxBridge L2 agent

![Linuxbridge agent support arrived](images/Agent-arrived.jpg)


???
__And now here it comes.__ In Mitaka we provided support for QoS bw limit also
in LB agent...

# QoS in LinuxBridge agent in details

* LinuxBridge agent use tc (traffic control) Linux tool
* policing on ingress qdisc (queueing discipline)

![Egress traffic explanation](images/Egress_traffic.png)

???
qdisc is short for 'queueing discipline' and it is elementary to under-
standing traffic control. Whenever the kernel needs to send a packet to
an  interface,  it  is enqueued to the qdisc configured for that inter-
face. Immediately afterwards, the kernel tries to get as  many  packets
as  possible  from  the  qdisc,  for giving them to the network adaptor
driver. (from tc manpage)

__Tell about confusing thing here__

---

class: center

# How TBF qdisc works

![how tbf works](images/how_tbf_works.png)  
source: http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/100797

???
- There is metaphorical object called "bucket". Extra
  tokens are lost.
- The size of the bucket is called burst.
- When kernel wants to send packets to network, packets are enqueue in packet
  queue (qdisc).
- In order to actually transmit a packet onto the network, that packet must
  obtain tokens equal to its size in bytes or mpu (whichever is larger).

__Important setting here is value of burst:__
* too low - configured bw limit will not be reached
* too high - too many packets will have tokens and bw_limit higher than expected

# Example with LinuxBridge agent:

```bash
neutron qos-bandwidth-limit-rule-create --max-kbps 512 \
                                        --max-burst-kbps 1024 \
                                        example-policy
```
![arrow down](images/down_arrow.png)

```bash
tc qdisc add dev tap ingress handle ffff:
tc filter add dev tap parent ffff: protocol all prio 49 basic\
    police rate 512kbit burst 1024kbit mtu 65535 drop
```

???

So bw limit configured in Neutron with command ... will be applied by LB agent
by executing ...

To say:
* In fact it makes exactly same TC command as Openvswitch is doing so at the end
  limits are applied in exactly same way for both L2 agents.

* MTU value here is the maximum packet size handled by the policer. Larger ones
  will be handled like they exceeded the configured rate, so will be dropped in
  our case.

# QoS in Mitaka

## Egress bandwidth limit for:

* Openvswitch L2 agent
* SR-IOV L2 agent
* __LinuxBridge L2 agent__

???

Finally in Mitaka all 3 main L2 agents from ML2 plugin supports Egress bw limit
rule from QoS \o/

---

# Side effect:

* L2 extension drivers in LinuxBridge agent
* Fullstack tests for LinuxBridge agent

???

During the work on QoS for LB agent we achieved 2 other things...

To say:
* L2 extension drivers - tell that it's new in Liberty and QoS is implemented that way...
* support for LB in fullstack tests

---

name: rbac_in_mitaka
# QoS in Mitaka: Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

In the Liberty release, policies could be shared
to all projects (tenants).

```bash
$ neutron qos-policy-create shared-policy --shared
```
In *Mitaka*, thanks to RBAC integration, QoS policies
can be shared to specific projects.


```bash

$ neutron qos-policy-create the-policy
$ neutron rbac-create --target-tenant <project-uuid> --action access_as_shared \
                      --type qos-policy <policy-uuid>
_
```


???

Talk about how policy.json works, and how operators
can modify that to allow non-administrator creating
and sharing policies too.

# Newton and beyond (rfe-approved)

RFEs: http://bit.ly/neutron-qos-rfes-approved

* DSCP marking rules (L3 marking)
* Ingress bandwidth limiting

???
Explain what an RFE is: use case proposal, high level.


---

class: center

# DSCP Marking Rule:

1. Create policy
```bash
neutron qos-policy-create dscp-marking
```
2. Create DSCP marking rule:
```bash
neutron qos-dscp-marking-rule-create dscp-marking --dscp-mark 26
```
3. Assign policy to a port
```bash
openstack network port-update \
     48c6256f-9123-4e39-a321-108782807cfc --qos-policy dscp-marking
```

# Newton: Ingress bandwidth limiting

* data consuming apps: crawlers, dataminers, etc.
* planning and allocation of bandwidth in general.

```bash
neutron qos-bandwidth-limit-rule-create --max-kbps 512 \
                                        --max-burst-kbps 1024 \
                                        --direction ingress \
                                        example-policy
```

* adds direction field to the bandwidth limit rule.
    * ingress
    * egress (default)

???
Note: SR-IOV does not suport ingress bw limit afaik,
we may need to filter requests on ingress direction (or prevent
it for vnic types other than vifs)

# Default policy for tenant

Raw proposal:

```bash

$ neutron qos-policy-create the-policy
$ neutron rbac-create --target-tenant <project-uuid> --action default \
                      --type qos-policy <policy-uuid>

$
```

When the tenant creates a resource (port), it gets attache to this
policy by default.

---
# VLAN 802.1p Support

* L2 level (in contrast with L3 of DSCP)
* For vlan provider networks
* Could be leveraged to prioritize tenant traffic segmented on vlan.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1505631

---
# Rate limit external conectivity

---
# Leveraging ECN

---
